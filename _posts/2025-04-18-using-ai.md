For a number of years I did my programming exclusively in R. There were a few reasons for this:

1. I knew how to use it
2. It was performant enough for the things that I was using it for
3. THere are some things that I legitimately like about the language

Of course I also griped about it often, how hard it was to have any semblance of a proper IDE experience<sup>[1](#ai1)</sup>. I complained about how it didn't have a proper object oriented paradigm, instead having four (or is it five now?).

I had my first experience with GitHub Copilot when it first came out. I was extremely unimpressed.

<a name="ai1">1:</a> I still maintain the best was using emacs and ESS desipite the steep learning curve, but admittedly, I haven't used Positron. I have used VSCode plenty though, and plenty of other Electron apps. And let me tell you, yuck. Seriously-- it's writing text, there ought not to be any
