A little while back, I was going on and on about how great s4 classes and methods are. Sure, they give you a lot of structure, and creating s4 objects is a dream because you can set them to enforce lots of rules about type checking. That's all great.

I've gotten into debugging a lot recently though. R and RStudio's debugging facilities are spotty enough. I still can't figure out how to debug one test at a time without putting them each in separate files<sup>[2](#s4c)[3]</sup>. But for the life of me, I have *never* been successful in debugging, or even stepping through, an S4 method. I've tried using `browser()`, `trace()`, RStudio breakpoints, they all skip over the method call without letting you step in. [Here is a post from about 14 years ago](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2004-July/055230.html) but that just doesn't seem to work.

That's changed drastically my views on using S4 classes, ever. [Hadley recommends](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html) looking at the [Matrix Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Matrix/index.html) as a good example of the S4 class system. I don't disagree. All of the methods are really short - most about one line. And if not, they're defined as functions elsewhere, which could be called directly in tests. It's not the worst idea but it's more challenging to follow.
